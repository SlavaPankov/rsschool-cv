## About me:

I graduated from the Nidegorod Technical University, bachelor's degree. I joined IT a little over a year ago. I was fascinated by web development, and specifically front-end, because I want to create things that people enjoy. 
I started by studying the profession in Skillbox courses. Studied weblayout, basic JS. Six months later, I received the first offer at an Internet marketing agency. But the learning and development did not stop there. I started learning React in Vue, also learned native PHP. 
I eagerly absorb new information for myself and try to develop as a competent specialist. And now I work as a business process developer.
My goal here is to consolidate my knowledge, as well as meet people to exchange experience.
